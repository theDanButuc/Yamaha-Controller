## Summary by Priority

Not everything here should be built — only features with clear daily-use value. The categories below reflect implementation complexity, not necessity.

### 🟢 Quick wins (< 2h each, high value)
- **Sleep Timer** — one picker + `setSleepTimer` API call
- **Play/Pause keyboard shortcut (P)** — two lines in AppDelegate key monitor
- **Device reboot** — one button + confirm dialog
- **Clock auto-sync** — `setClock` with current Mac time
- **Wake volume on alarm** — add volume picker to existing MorningAlarmView
- **Zoom in/out** — adjust popover frame size

### 🟡 Half-day features (worth doing, moderate effort)
- **Balance slider**
- **Equalizer** (3 sliders + mode)
- **Scenes row** — `getSceneInfo` + `setScene`, similar to SceneButtonsView
- **Firmware update check + trigger**
- **Dark/Light/System theme** — extend current color scheme system
- **Filter / reorder source buttons** — drag-reorder in Settings
- **Alarm: one-day mode + fade-in**

### 🔴 Skip or defer (structural changes, diminishing returns)
- **Multi-room / MusicCast linking** — entire architecture rethink
- **Multiple device support** — multi-receiver state management
- **Zone 2/3/4** — hardware-dependent, TSR-400 likely unsupported
- **Browse/search streaming content** — each service needs its own API
- **MusicCast playlists / queue management** — complex, low daily use
- **Multiple alarms** — refactor of alarm system
- **Routines** — significant automation engine
- **Localization** — overhead without benefit for personal use
